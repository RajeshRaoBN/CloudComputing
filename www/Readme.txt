Project: Intelligent Job Board
Project Description: A simple job board to automate candidate search as well as job search. Imagine an intelligent job board which not only searches the job suitable for you and apply automatically. Now imagine the same job board that can streamline the candidate search and communicate directly with the candidates soliciting applications from them. That is what this job board does.
